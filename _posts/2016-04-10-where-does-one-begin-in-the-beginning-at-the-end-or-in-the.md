# Where does one begin? In the beginning, at the end or in the middle? 

After writing multiple blog posts in my head published only for the joy of my subconscious I realised that the best point to start telling my story from is right now. 

Right now I am about to head off to teach a yin class. The sun is shining over the tree circle in my back yard and the cockatoos are screaming in their regular fashion. 

Right now I am preparing to move into my first home that we will own, my little family. I'm saying goodbye to a beautiful but small apartment next to my father and hello to responsibility.

Right now I am also preparing to teach my very first yoga workshop for myself in the tree circle. 

I'm starting to own my own practice as a business for the first time since surrendering to the fact that yoga is in fact my chosen path. Completely and utterly. It hasn't been a short journey. Over 20 years now. But we will come to that.

Amazing how many right nows we can be in in any one moment.
